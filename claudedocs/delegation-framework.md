# Delegation Framework Implementation Guide

## Overview

Based on the comprehensive requirements analysis, this framework addresses the systematic delegation failures and implements the "show sub agents too" requirement.

## Delegation Execution Model

### Phase 1: Pre-Delegation Assessment
```
BEFORE creating any delegates:
1. Git branch check (RULES.md Line 136) ✓ production → feature/delegation
2. Requirements clarity assessment ✓ "show sub agents too" = visibility system
3. RULES.md compliance verification ✓ All critical rules checked
4. Success criteria definition ✓ Clear metrics established
```

### Phase 2: Delegation Architecture
```
Delegation Hierarchy:
requirements-analyst (primary)
├── socratic-mentor (requirements clarity)
├── learning-guide (methodology analysis)
├── quality-engineer (compliance audit)
└── technical-writer (implementation specs)

Each delegate receives:
- Complete session context
- RULES.md compliance mandate
- Specific deliverable requirements
- Success/failure criteria
```

### Phase 3: Visibility Implementation
```
Sub-Agent Visibility System:
├── Real-time status display
├── Work product attribution
├── Decision rationale capture
└── Progress tracking dashboard
```

## Implementation Recommendations

### Critical Fixes (Implement First)
1. **Switch to Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/delegation-framework
   ```

2. **Establish Delegation Template**
   ```
   DELEGATE BRIEF TEMPLATE:
   - Role: [specific agent type]
   - Context: [complete session history]
   - Constraint: [tool limitations]
   - Deliverable: [specific output required]
   - Success Criteria: [measurable outcomes]
   - RULES.md Compliance: [mandatory]
   ```

3. **Create Monitoring System**
   - Track delegation status in real-time
   - Capture all sub-agent outputs
   - Maintain attribution chains
   - Provide rollback capabilities

### User Requirement Fulfillment

The "show sub agents too" requirement translates to:
- **Visibility**: Real-time delegation status
- **Attribution**: Clear sub-agent work products
- **Transparency**: Decision rationale from delegates
- **Monitoring**: Progress tracking and failure alerts

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Delegation success rate >95%
- ✅ RULES.md compliance >90%
- ✅ User visibility into all sub-agent operations
- ✅ Context preservation through delegation chains
- ✅ Clean rollback from delegation failures

## Next Steps

1. Implement critical fixes immediately
2. Test delegation framework with simple tasks
3. Scale to complex operations once proven
4. Monitor and optimize based on performance metrics
